It's impressively simple! ♻️\n\n## 📱 Mobile Users Welcome!\n\nNo worries! The components are fully responsive! ⚡\n\n ![img7.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcGoPbnekagshgHdLxLU98LH1pMY1WLTiCGCnXXmrayFY/img7.png) \n\nNo need to adjust settings. They automatically adapt to the viewport! 😊\n\n## 🔍 How to Use Them?\n\nI created a [quick start guide](https://github.com/mtyszczak/hive-components?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-start) 🧠 in my repository.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n```html\n<!-- Prepare imports for our components -->\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n  {\n    \"imports\": {\n      \"lit\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lit/dist@3/core/lit-core.min.js\",\n      \"@hiveio/internal\": \"https://gtg.openhive.network/5bb236/hive-internal.js\"\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n\n<!-- Import components we want -->\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"https://gtg.openhive.network/5bb236/hive-post.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"https://gtg.openhive.network/5bb236/hive-witness.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"https://gtg.openhive.network/5bb236/hive-comments.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"https://gtg.openhive.network/5bb236/hive-tag.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- Use the components -->\n<hive-witness account=\"gtg\"></hive-witness>\n<hive-post permlink=\"@gtg/hello-world\"></hive-post>\n<hive-comments permlink=\"@gtg/hello-world\"></hive-comments>\n<hive-tag tag=\"photography\" posts-per-page=\"4\" url-template=\"/photography/{permlink}\"></hive-tag>\n```\n\n## 🧛🏻‍♀️ For Night Owls\n\nIntroducing the ✨ **dark theme** ✨:\n\n ![img8.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmdAAobQMwVS4qFNLvSrVFnqr7iHda2t6ErwZefWTf3yxn/img8.png) \n\nJust set the `theme=\"dark\"` attribute on any component and you're good to go! 💪\n\n## 🎨 Want More Colors?\n\nCustomize your communities and websites with just a few lines of CSS! 🤩\n\n```css\nhive-comments {\n  --hive-on-surface: blue;\n}\n```\n\nAnd here are the results: 👇\n\n ![img9.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVeRbsM31kshvF8LXXRauRMVfjdSYKHWRJTCvhMhTZKvJ/img9.png) \n\n## 📈 Need More Components?\n\nGreat! I love your spirit! 👻\n\nYou can request a new component by [creating an issue](https://github.com/mtyszczak/hive-components/issues/new) 💡 or suggest edits by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/mtyszczak/hive-components/pulls) 🛠️\n\n## 💾 Component Sizes\n\nI understand not everyone has super-fast internet 📟\n\nSo, I worked to make the components as compact as possible! ⬇️\n\n| Name | Size |\n|------|------|\n| Lit core | 7 kB |\n| Hive Witness | 19 kB |\n| Hive Post | 29.3 kB |\n| Hive Comments | 46.9 kB |\n| Hive Tag | 50.2 kB |\n| Hive internals | 640 kB |\n\nAnd remember, these script sizes are not gzipped yet! They are cached by browsers and executed only once per page load, on demand! 🤯\n\n## 💲 Pricing\n\nJust kidding 🤣 It's completely 🆓 🗽\n\nFeel free to visit [the repository](https://github.com/mtyszczak/hive-components) to contribute or use the components via CDN, thanks to @gtg 🧙‍♂️\n\n## 🌟 Future Plans\n\nI have a [few ideas](https://github.com/mtyszczak/hive-components/issues) in mind, and there are areas I can improve, but we did it! 📣\n\nMVP is on board! 💎\n\nI strongly encourage you to use the Hive components! 🖼️\n\n---\n\nImages from private archive & chatgpt.com\n",
