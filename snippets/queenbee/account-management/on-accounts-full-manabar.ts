 * Demo: onAccountsFullManabar() ‚Äî notify when accounts reach 98% manabar.
 *
 * This observer monitors manabar levels and triggers when any specified account reaches 98% manabar capacity.
 * You can specify a manabar kind to be monitored (expressed by values of {@link EManabarType}).
 * Multiple account names can be observed at single observer call.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `manabarType: EManabarType` - The type of manabar to monitor (RC, UPVOTE, or DOWNVOTE)
 * - `...accounts: TAccountName[]` - Account names to monitor for full manabar
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IManabarProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
