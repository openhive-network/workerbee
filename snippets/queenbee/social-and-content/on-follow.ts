 *
 * This observer monitors social graph changes on the Hive blockchain including
 * follow actions, mute actions, and blacklist actions. Tracks relationship changes
 * between accounts. Multiple accounts can be monitored simultaneously.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `...accounts: TAccountName[]` - Account names to monitor for follow/mute/blacklist activity
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IFollowProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
