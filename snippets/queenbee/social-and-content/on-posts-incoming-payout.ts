 * Demo: onPostsIncomingPayout() ‚Äî monitor posts near payout window.
 *
 * This observer triggers when posts by specified authors are approaching their
 * payout window (7 days after creation). Useful for monitoring earnings and
 * content performance before final payout. Multiple authors can be monitored simultaneously.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `relative: string` - Time window specification (e.g., "-1h" for last hour before payout)
 * - `...authors: TAccountName[]` - Author account names to monitor for upcoming payouts
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IPostMetadataProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
