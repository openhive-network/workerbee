 * This is the foundational snippet that demonstrates WorkerBee's core concepts.
 * The observer triggers on every new block and provides comprehensive block header data.
 * No input parameters required as it monitors all blocks.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - No parameters required (monitors all new blocks)
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IBlockHeaderProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
